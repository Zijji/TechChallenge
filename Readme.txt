Approach:

The endpoint POST api/v1/warehouse/fulfilment will be created using AXIS. 
Though it's not the most feature complete, it should be suitable for this job.

Fulfilment will be created as a java application and deployed to a Tomcat server.
The client will be used to return orders that are unfulfillable.

First step: Develop endpoint on server
Second step: Develop client
